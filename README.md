# Title of Dataset: Timing and Fitness Consequences of Introgression in Speciation
---

SLiM source code of our model for speciation dynamics used to generate figures in the paper.

## Description of the code and file structure

This repository contains all the necessary code and resources to perform individual-based population genetics simulations using **SLiM 4.3** (Haller and Messer, 2023). Below is an explanation of the folder structure and the contents of each directory:

### 1. Folder: Constant Population Size
This folder contains SLiM source code files designed to simulate scenarios with a constant population size. The files included are:

- **Introgression_Mutation-order.slim**  
- **Introgression_Earlyphase.slim**  
- **Introgression_Latephase.slim**  
- **Introgression_Ecological.slim**  

These files represent different simulation scenarios and are self-explanatory based on their filenames. Each file is configured for specific evolutionary conditions or events and is referenced directly in the accompanying manuscript.

---

### 2. Folder: Variable Population Size
This folder includes SLiM source code for simulations where population size changes over time. The structure and filenames mirror those in the **Constant Population Size** folder:

- **Introgression_Mutation-order.slim**  
- **Introgression_Earlyphase.slim**  
- **Introgression_Latephase.slim**  
- **Introgression_Ecological.slim**  

These files also represent specific simulation scenarios and align with those discussed in the manuscript.

---

### 3. Folder: Run and Plot
This folder contains Python scripts for managing and visualizing simulation results. These scripts include:

- **`Simulation_loop.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook used to repeatedly execute the SLiM simulation code across various parameter settings.

- **`Fitness_reduction.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook designed to analyze and plot the reduction in hybrid fitness across different migration rates.

- **`Plot.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook that reproduces figures presented in the manuscript, enabling a direct comparison with published results.

- **`Hybrid_speciation.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook that explores hybrid speciation and calculates relative establishment probabilities.

### 4. Folder: Data  
This folder contains the raw and processed data files used to generate the figures and analyses in this repository. It includes:

- `.dat` files with raw simulation outputs.  
- `.csv` files produced by preprocessing scripts for faster plotting.  

All data required by the notebooks in Run and Plot (e.g., fitness trajectories, SFS, variation metrics) should be placed here.

Note: The Data folder contains only smaller processed files, which are sufficient to reproduce most figures in the manuscript. The complete set of raw simulation outputs is very large and not included here, but can be generated by running the SLiM code provided in this repository. Alternatively, please contact the author to request access to the full raw data.

### Notes
All source code and scripts are organized for reproducibility and straightforward execution. Ensure that **SLiM 4.3** is installed prior to running the simulations, and refer to the relevant sections of the manuscript for detailed explanations of each simulation scenario.
